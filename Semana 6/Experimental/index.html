	<p> Hammers are basic tools in many trades. The usual features are a head (most often made of steel) and a handle (also called a helve or haft). Most hammers are hand tools, but there are also many powered versions, called power hammers (such as steam hammers and trip hammers) for heavier uses, such as forging.

	Some hammers have other names, such as sledgehammer, mallet and gavel. The term "hammer" also applies to other devices that deliver blows, such as the hammer of a firearm or the hammer of a piano.
